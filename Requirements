REQUIREMENTS
These are the core, constitutional ideas of the S16 wavesharing system.
They are not solutions, just the basic agreement between musicians who want
their gear to get nasty together.

1. Collaboration is consensual.
  My inputs are built to my specification. Your outputs are built to your specification.
  That is, my gear takes optical input through a LEGO connection. That's what I'm asking for.
  Your output is guaranteed optical, terminating in a particular LEGO connection. That's what you offer.
  Culturally, you hand me the pulsing end of your cable and ask me to put it where I want.
  You might want to put it into a particular socket, and maybe I'm into it,
  but maybe I want to put it into a different socket. Worst that happens is we're disappointed with the results.
2. No one's gear can damage anyone else's gear.
  I'm using optical buffering because no one is going to generate a light bright enough
  to damage anyone else's gear, and it keeps everyone ground completely isolated.
  If my gear blows up, it's because of my mistake (or, yes, Mssrs. Pauline and Tinguely, my deliberate artistic decision).
  Your gear is extremely unlikely to blow up, but if it does, a) the cable will probably go first (no big deal),
  and anyway, it's a mistake you made along the way that I can't have had responsibility for.
3. Graceful degradation of signal.
  If I make a cable, it works well, or offers weak signal, or does nothing.
  The cables, themselves, might produce interesting distortion, so you might use a particular cable for its interesting effect.
4. Takes backward-compatible CV.
  No one's gear needs to be modified to send a signal, only to receive it. See: principle 1.
  Different LEDs and resistors might be better for different CV schemes.
  That's up to the sender to build cables that work best for them.
